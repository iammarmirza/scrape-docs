# Analyzers

![](https://files.readme.io/f2f9f7e-small-Analyzers.png)

DeepSource Analyzers inspect and evaluate the source code within a repository, detecting potential issues and monitoring key metrics to ensure the highest possible code health. Our Analyzers are designed to report on issues across various categories, including anti-patterns, bug risks, security, performance, style, and documentation.

By generating issues for developers to review and fix, DeepSource Analyzers empowers teams to maintain code quality and increase productivity. Furthermore, our Analyzers generate and track essential metrics, such as dependency counts and documentation coverage, both at the file and repository levels. At the file level, the analyzer can identify the specific location of an anti-pattern, while at the repository level, it can flag instances where dependencies have not been installed.
