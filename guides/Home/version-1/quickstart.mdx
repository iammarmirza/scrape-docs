To get started with DeepSource, follow these two easy steps:

1.  using your existing GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps Services account. Once you've signed up, DeepSource will ask permission to install the app for that provider in your account.
2.  by selecting a repository on which you'd like to activate continuous analysis, generating the configuration, and activating the analysis. The initial analysis will be triggered on the default branch of the repository, and all subsequent commits and pull requests will be automatically analyzed.

To use DeepSource, ensure you have a GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or Azure DevOps Services account with at least one repository containing one of the supported languages.

If you're not in the mood for reading, don't worry. You can simply watch this brief video to help you get started.
