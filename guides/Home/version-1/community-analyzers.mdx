# Community Analyzers

Community Analyzers are third-party, open-source static analyzers supported by DeepSource.

Unlike , Community analyzers do not run on DeepSource's infrastructure. Instead, they are run on CI systems and the results are reported to DeepSource. This approach allows you to use DeepSource with a broader range of technologies and languages, and manage the issues in a centralized dashboard. Furthermore, this integration enables you to leverage DeepSource's features such as Quality Gates, Issue diffing, ignore rules setup, for the issues identified by these Community Analyzers.

Issues detected by these analyzers can be found in the [Analyzer Directory](https://app.deepsource.com/directory/) under the respective analyzer.

Setting up Community Analyzers on your repository

## [](#setting-up-community-analyzers-on-your-repository)

Incorporating Community Analyzers into your workflow is a simple process.

1.  Begin by adding the analyzer into your `.deepsource.toml` configuration file. This step is akin to activating core analyzers in DeepSource.
2.  Set up the `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` environment variable within your Continuous Integration (CI) system.
3.  Finally, integrate the analyzer into your CI system. For your convenience, we provide pre-formulated CI snippets for all major CI systems. Simply select and insert the appropriate snippet for the respective analyzer from the [Analyzer Directory](https://app.deepsource.com/directory) into your chosen CI system's configuration.

Let's go through these steps in detail. Community Analyzers accepts [SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) report and syncs the issues from the report on DeepSource. The SARIF report can be generated by running the analyzer on your CI pipeline.

1.  Enable the analyzer by adding it to your repository's `.deepsource.toml` config file. For example, if you want to enable [Dart Analyze](https://app.deepsource.com/directory/analyzers/dart-analyze) on your project, add the following to your `.deepsource.toml` file:

    TOML

    `[[analyzers]] name = "dart-analyze" type = "community"`

    We recommend you perform this action from your dashboard by navigating to the respective _Repository â†’ Settings â†’ Configuration_ and then clicking on the _Regenerate Configuration_ button. In case, you are activating a repository for the first time, please use the feature from your team's dashboard.

    > ## ðŸš§
    >
    > The following steps can only be performed after activating a repository. In case, you are activating a repository for the first time, please commit the configuration first before continuing.

2.  Set up `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` environment variable for the project in your CI/CD pipeline. The DSN is used to associate the analysis report to the repository. This needs to be configured before sending the analysis report to DeepSource.

    To look up the DSN:

    1.  Go to the Settings page of the repository dashboard in DeepSource
    2.  Go to the `General` tab
    3.  Click on Copy button to copy your DSN mentioned under `Data Source Name (DSN)`

    ![dsn-screenshot](https://files.readme.io/bd22ec7-In_1.png)

3.  Set up a workflow file to run the analyzer on your CI/CD pipeline. We want to achieve the following in the workflow file:

    1.  Install and run the analyzer on an event of your choice. We recommend you do this on every push to the default branch of the repository and branches that have a pull/merge request open.
    2.  Send the analysis report to DeepSource once the analyzer has run and generated a SARIF report.

    For all supported analyzers, we have ready to use workflow files for selected CI mentioned in the analyzer's page in the [DeepSource Directory](https://app.deepsource.com/directory/#community-analyzers). You can copy the workflow file from there, and you'd be good to go.

    Here's an example for the [Dart Analyze](https://app.deepsource.com/directory/analyzers/dart-analyze) analyzer:

    YAML

    `` # A copy-paste Github Actions config to run dart-analyze and report the artifact to DeepSource name: Scan with dart-analyze  on:   # Note that both `push` and `pull_request` triggers should be present for GitHub to consistently present dart-analyze   # SARIF reports.   push:     branches: [main, master]   pull_request:  jobs:   scan:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       contents: read # for actions/checkout to fetch code       security-events: write # for github/codeql-action/upload-sarif to upload SARIF results       actions: read # only required for a private repository by github/codeql-action/upload-sarif to get the Action run status     steps:       - name: Code Checkout         uses: actions/checkout@v3         with:           ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}        - name: Setup Dart         uses: dart-lang/setup-dart@v1        - name: Run Dart Analyze         run: dart analyze > dart_analyze.txt || true        - name: Dart Analyze to SARIF         uses: advanced-security/dart-analyzer-sarif@main         with:           input: dart_analyze.txt           output: dart_analyze.sarif        - name: Upload SARIF report to DeepSource         run: |           # Install the CLI           curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh            # Send the report to DeepSource           ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer dart-analyze --analyzer-type community --value-file ./dart_analyze.sarif          env:           DEEPSOURCE_DSN: ${{ secrets.DEEPSOURCE_DSN }} ``

> ## ðŸ“˜
>
> If you already have a workflow file for your CI provider, or it is not listed in the analyzer's page, you can add the following step to your workflow file to send the analysis report to DeepSource (in the syntax of your CI provider):
>
> YAML
>
> `- name: Upload SARIF report files to DeepSource        run: |          # Install the CLI          curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh           # Send the report to DeepSource         ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer <analyzer-shortcode> --analyzer-type community --value-file <path-to-sarif-report>`
>
> We have used an example of GitHub Actions here. You can port the command to your CI provider's syntax.  
> Please make sure to replace the `<analyzer-shortcode>` and `<path-to-sarif-report>` with the actual values.

How does it work?

## [](#how-does-it-work)

Once you have set up the analyzer on your project, open a pull request or push a commit to your default branch. You should be able to see the issues from the analyzer on your project's dashboard in DeepSource.

Please note that the Issues are shown on the dashboard only for the reports sent for runs on the default branch of the repository, as configured on DeepSource.

For a Pull/Merge Request, you'll see only new issues in the files that are introduced and not all the issues. This is to help you focus on the new issues introduced by the PR and not deal with noise from issues that are not related to the changes in the pull request.

> ## ðŸ“˜
>
> New issues are the issues that are not present in the default branch of the repository. In the behavior described above, DeepSource compares the file's issue in the PR with the ones present in the default branch, and shows only the new ones in the analysis run.
