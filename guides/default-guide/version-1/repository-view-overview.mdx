Overview Tab
============

The Overview tab provides a concise overview of your repository's code health. It displays the total number of issues detected by DeepSource, broken down by category, and valuable insights into your code's overall health.

Codebase report

---------------------------------------

The Codebase report provides a comprehensive overview of all issues detected in the repository, categorized by type for a bird's-eye view of the overall status of your code.

The Codebase report offers a high-level summary of all issues detected in the repository, categorized by issue type. You can customize the report by selecting up to eight issue categories of your choice.
