Managing access to your team's repositories
===========================================

Repository permission levels for a team

[](#repository-permission-levels-for-a-team)
=======================================================================================

You can customize access to each repository in your team with granular permission levels, giving people access to the features and tasks they need.

People with admin permissions can manage access level of an individual to a team owned repository.

Each permission level increases access to a repository's content and settings. Choose the level that is the most appropriate for a person's role in your project without giving people more access than they need.

In the order of least to most access, the permission levels for a repository are:

*   Read-only: Recommended for non-code contributors who only want to view the dashboard, without modifying anything.
*   Write: Recommended for people who actively push code to the project, who need the ability to modify settings.
*   Admin: Recommended for people who need full access, including the ability to add or remove people to the repository.

Set base (default) permissions for your team

[](#set-base-default-permissions-for-your-team)
===============================================================================================

Team Administrators can set base permissions for the team owned repositories.

About base permissions

[](#about-base-permissions)
-----------------------------------------------------

Base permissions apply to all members of a team when accessing any of the team's repositories. Base permissions do not apply to contributors, or administrators.

If someone with admin permissions to a team's repository, grants a member a higher level of permission for the repository, the higher level of permission overrides the base permission.

> For a newly added team, the default repository permission on DeepSource is set to the same value that you've configured on GitHub. For other VCS, by default, team members will have **Write** permissions to all team repositories.

> 🚧
> --
> 
> For open source repositories, all members (and contributors) have write permissions in spite of the selection of base permissions.

Manage an individual's access to a team repository

[](#manage-an-individuals-access-to-a-team-repository)
============================================================================================================

People with admin permissions can manage the access of team members and contributors to a team repository.

Adding a collaborator

[](#adding-a-collaborator)
---------------------------------------------------

You can add members who are already in your team to the repository, either as a member or a contributor. To add new members, please invite them to your team first.

> 🚧
> --
> 
> Contributors can only be added as collaborators for open source repositories. For private repositories, contributors first need to be promoted to members.

To add a collaborator:

1.  Go to the repository dashboard.
2.  Go to the **Settings** tab.
3.  Click on the **Collaborators** tab under **Settings**.
4.  Click **Add collaborator**.
5.  Type their name, or email address in the search box. Once you find the individual, click on their name.
    
    > 📘
    > --
    > 
    > If you cannot find someone, make sure that they are added to the team.
    
6.  Select the required permission level, and click **Confirm and add**.
