Test Coverage
=============

The Test coverage Analyzer uses coverage report files generated after running tests to perform analysis.

Enabling this Analyzer will show you coverage metrics like Line Coverage, Branch Coverage, Condition Coverage, and, Composite Coverage.  
The Analyzer also looks at lines of code that were never executed by any tests and raises actionable issues for them.

This section covers steps to get started with the `test-coverage` Analyzer. Please make sure to read the general [configuration guide](https://deepsource-docs.readme.io/docs/configuration) first.

Configuration - `.deepsource.toml`

[](#configuration---deepsourcetoml)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable the Test coverage Analyzer, make sure you have it enabled in your `.deepsource.toml` configuration file.  
This can be done by adding the following entry:

TOML

`[[analyzers]] name = "test-coverage" enabled = true`

Setup Test Coverage

[](#setup-test-coverage)
-----------------------------------------------

The analysis begins as soon as the Analyzer recieves a valid coverage report. To do this, you can hook up the DeepSource CLI with your test CI and send the coverage report as soon as the tests finishes.

### 

Set up `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` environment variable

[](#set-up-deepsource_dsn-environment-variable)

DSN is used to associate the coverage artifact to the repository. This needs to be configured before sending a coverage artifact for analysis.

To look up the DSN:

*   Go to the **Settings** page of the repository dashboard in DeepSource
*   Go to the **Code Coverage** Section
*   Click on **Copy** button to copy your DSN.

![](https://files.readme.io/9736302-test-coverage-image.png)

Once you get the DSN, please make sure you store it as an environment variable named `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` in your CI's environment.

### 

Installing DeepSource CLI in your CI enviroment

[](#installing-deepsource-cli-in-your-ci-enviroment)

Bash

`curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh`

This command will create a `bin` directory in the command's current working directory(`$PWD`/`$0`).  
`deepsource` executable will be present inside `bin`.  
We would use this executable for our CLI to DeepSource from now.

### 

Reporting coverage artifact using the cli

[](#reporting-coverage-artifact-using-the-cli)

This is the final step. Once you have the Test coverage reports generated. You can send it to DeepSource using the CLI.

Here's how the command looks like:

Bash

`./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key <key> --value-file <absolute-path-of-the-coverage report>`

In the above command, `<key>` is the language for which you'd be sending the coverage report.  
Here's the whitelist of the keys and their respective formats we support.

Key

Value format

python

XML (Cobertura), LCOV

go

cover.out (Generated)

javascript

XML (Cobertura), LCOV

ruby

JSON (SimpleCov)

java

XML (Jacoco/Clover), LCOV

kotlin

XML (Jacoco, Kover)

scala

Please refer 'report' command of if you want to read more on the command usage.

> ðŸ“˜
> --
> 
> Please make sure you always run the above cli `report` command from the root of your repo. This will make sure that the filepaths in the test reports are handled to take care directories from your CI if they are present.
> 
> Failing to do that might result in issues not getting raised for your project. You'd still be able to see the metrics.

> ðŸ“˜
> --
> 
> The maximum allowed size for the coverage report file is 20 MB.

### 

Submitting Multiple coverage reports

[](#submitting-multiple-coverage-reports)

DeepSource supports merging coverage reports implicitly. If you have multiple CI pipelines generating partial coverage reports, send them as soon as they are generated under the same key name. DeepSource will combine all of them to prepare a final result. For example, if two CI pipelines test platform-specific parts of a module, you can report both the artifacts, and DeepSource will implicitly combine the results of the reports.

You'll notice a newly updated check every time you submit a new artifact. There's no time limit for sending multiple coverage reports.

> ðŸ“˜
> --
> 
> The `JaCoCo` and `Clover` coverage formats report metrics for individual methods and may not contain data about the individual covered lines in the methods.
> 
> For such cases, DeepSource uses a `max` operation on the reported metrics to calculate the aggregate report. So if parts of certain methods are covered in different coverage reports, the reported line coverage for that method may be lower than the actual line coverage.
> 
> For example, if one report covers the top 25% lines for a method, and another report covers the bottom 25% lines for the same method, since there is no way of knowing if both the lines in the reports are different, DeepSource will report the coverage to be 25% even though it might be 50%. This is only a limitation for `JaCoCo` and `Clover` coverage formats at the moment.

Examples

[](#examples)
-------------------------

### 

JavaScript

[](#javascript)

#### 

Jest

[](#jest)

Currently, only the Cobertura XML format is supported by DeepSource.

Here are the steps to report JavaScript coverage data.

Bash

``# Make sure `jest` is installed. If not, install it using `yarn` yarn add --dev jest # OR `npm` npm install --save-dev jest  # Add the following options to the jest config to get a cobertura report "collectCoverage": true, "coverageReporters": ["cobertura"]  # Or, add these options as flags to test script in package.json {   "scripts": {     "test": "jest --coverage=true --coverageReporters=cobertura"   } }  # Run the tests yarn test # OR npm test  # Install 'deepsource CLI' curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key javascript --value-file ./coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml``

> ðŸ“˜
> --
> 
> If the coverage file is generated at a path other than the root directory, pass that path to the value-file flag of the last command.
> 
> Example :
> 
> `./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key javascript --value-file ./src/app/coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml`

### 

Go

[](#go)

#### 

go test

[](#go-test)

The analyzer supports coverage profile (report) for all three modes â€” `set`, `atomic`, and `count` generated by the `go test`.

This is how you can generate a coverage profile and report it to the analyzer:

Bash

`# Run your tests and generate coverage report go test -coverprofile=cover.out  # Install 'deepsource CLI' curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key go --value-file ./cover.out`

**Note: Tests for different Go packages**

If you are running tests and generating coverage reports for different packages separately, you need to combine all generated coverage reports into a single file and submit that to the `test-coverage` analyzer.

This is how you can combine the coverage artifacts before reporting them:

Bash

`# Run tests for a package go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./somePackage  # Append coverage data in a separate file cat cover.out >> coverage.out  # Run tests for another package go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./someOtherPackage  # Combine the coverage data in the same way cat cover.out >> coverage.out  # Install 'deepsource CLI' curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the repository settings page export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://   # From the root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key go --value-file ./coverage.out`

### 

Python

[](#python)

#### 

unittests

[](#unittests)

Bash

`# Install coverage.py pacakage from pip pip install coverage  # Run coverage coverage run tests.py  # Generate coverage report in xml format coverage xml  # Install 'deepsource CLI' curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./coverage.xml`

#### 

pytest

[](#pytest)

Bash

`# Install pytest and pytest-cov pacakages from pip pip install pytest pytest-cov  # Run pytest with --cov and --cov-report flags pytest --cov=./ --cov-report xml  # Install deepsource CLI curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./coverage.xml`

**Reference**: [https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/plugins/coverage.html](https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/plugins/coverage.html)

#### 

NOTE: Usage with tox

[](#note-usage-with-tox)

If you are using [tox.readthedocs.io](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest), make sure you omit `.tox/*` and `env/*` in your `.coveragerc` file because when running tests with tox, the coverage report will contain test report files other than your source (e.g site-packages, etc).

Here's an example of a `.coveragerc` file:

Bash

`[run] branch = True source = src omit =     .tox/*     env/*`

With multiple python versions, combine the coverage data files before reporting.

Example `tox.ini` file:

Bash

`[tox] envlist = cov-init,py27,py36,py37,cov-report skipsdist=True skip_missing_interpreters=True   [testenv] setenv =     COVERAGE_FILE = .coverage.{envname} deps =     pytest     pytest-cov     coverage commands =     pytest --cov   [testenv:cov-init] skipsdist = True setenv =     COVERAGE_FILE = .coverage deps = coverage commands =     coverage erase   [testenv:cov-report] skipsdist = True setenv =     COVERAGE_FILE = .coverage deps = coverage commands =     coverage combine     coverage report     coverage xml`

### 

Ruby

[](#ruby)

#### 

SimpleCov

[](#simplecov)

First, install `simplecov` if it is not already installed.

Bash

`gem install simplecov`

Then, follow the steps below to generate a test coverage report.

1.  Add the following lines to the `spec_helper.rb` file inside the `tests` folder of your project:

Ruby

`# frozen_string_literal: true  require 'simplecov'  SimpleCov.start`

2.  Add `--require spec_helper.rb` to the `.rspec` file.
3.  Run rspec using `bundle exec rake rspec` to generate a coverage report.
4.  The coverage report will be available inside the `coverage` folder.

Once you have a coverage report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the following commands:

Bash

`# Install deepsource CLI curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key ruby --value-file ./coverage/.resultset.json`

> ðŸ“˜
> --
> 
> SimpleCov writes coverage results to a `.resultset.json` file. This is what you will want to upload to DeepSource.

### 

Java

[](#java)

The test coverage analyzer supports test coverage metrics for Jacoco and Clover XML reports.

#### 

Jacoco

[](#jacoco)

Setting up test coverage differs with each type of build system (Maven, Gradle, etc.). Here's an example of the configuration needed to run Jacoco on a maven repo:

XML

`<!-- Within pom.xml --> ...     <plugin>         <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>         <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>         <version>0.8.2</version>         <executions>             <execution>                 <goals>                     <goal>prepare-agent</goal>                 </goals>             </execution>             <!-- attached to Maven test phase -->             <execution>                 <id>report</id>                 <phase>test</phase>                 <goals>                     <goal>report</goal>                 </goals>             </execution>         </executions>     </plugin>  ...`

Once you've added Jacoco to your project's `pom.xml` file, you should be able to run tests and generate the coverage report. The default location of the coverage report is `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml`.

Shell

`mvn test`

In case your project has multiple modules, you will need to use the `jacoco:report-aggregate` goal to merge all reports together.

After you have the XML test report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the cli:

Shell

`# Install deepsource CLI curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set the DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the reporting tab of # your repository's DeepSource settings page. export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the project's root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key java --value-file target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml`

You should be able to proceed similarly with other build systems such as Ant or Gradle.

**Reference:** [Jacoco documentation](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/index.html)

#### 

Clover

[](#clover)

DeepSource also supports reports generated using Atlassian's Clover coverage framework. Here's an example of using it with Maven:

XML

    `...      <build>         <plugins>              ...              <plugin>                 <groupId>org.openclover</groupId>                 <artifactId>clover-maven-plugin</artifactId>                 <version>4.4.1</version>                 <configuration>                 </configuration>                 <executions>                     <execution>                         <phase>verify</phase>                         <goals>                             <goal>instrument</goal>                             <goal>aggregate</goal>                         </goals>                     </execution>                 </executions>             </plugin>         </plugins>     </build>      ...      <reporting>         <plugins>             <plugin>                 <groupId>org.openclover</groupId>                 <artifactId>clover-maven-plugin</artifactId>                 <version>4.4.1</version>             </plugin>         </plugins>     </reporting>      ...`

Once you have added these elements to your project's `pom.xml` file, you will be able to instrument and run tests:

Shell

`mvn clean clover:setup test clover:aggregate clover:clover`

This will run tests and in the case of a multimodule project, aggregate the results into a single clover report.

The default output directory for the report is `target/site/clover/clover.xml`.

After you have the XML test report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the cli:

Shell

`# Install deepsource CLI curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set the DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the reporting tab of # your repository's DeepSource settings page. export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the project's root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key java --value-file target/site/clover/clover.xml`

You should be able to proceed similarly with other build systems such as Ant or Gradle.

**Reference:** [Clover documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/clover/clover-documentation-home-71598318.html)

### 

Kotlin

[](#kotlin)

The test coverage analyzer supports test coverage metrics for Jacoco XML reports.

#### 

Jacoco

[](#jacoco-1)

Setting up test coverage differs with each type of build system (Maven, Gradle, etc.). Here's an example of the configuration needed to run Jacoco on a maven repo:

XML

`<!-- Within pom.xml --> ...     <plugin>         <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>         <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>         <version>0.8.2</version>         <executions>             <execution>                 <goals>                     <goal>prepare-agent</goal>                 </goals>             </execution>             <!-- attached to Maven test phase -->             <execution>                 <id>report</id>                 <phase>test</phase>                 <goals>                     <goal>report</goal>                 </goals>             </execution>         </executions>     </plugin> ...`

Once you've added Jacoco to your project's `pom.xml` file, you should be able to run tests and generate the coverage report. The default location of the coverage report is `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml`.

Shell

`mvn test`

After you have the XML test report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the cli:

Shell

`# Install deepsource CLI curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set the DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the reporting tab of # your repository's DeepSource settings page. export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the project's root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key kotlin --value-file target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml`

In case your project has multiple modules, you will need to use the `jacoco:report-aggregate` goal to merge all reports together.

#### 

Kover

[](#kover)

If you have a gradle project, you can set up kover for report generation as well.

Add the following in your top-level build file:

Kotlin

`plugins {      id("org.jetbrains.kotlinx.kover") version "0.7.2" }`

Once you've applied the Kover Gradle plugin, Kover tasks for report generation and verification will be created. To generate XML reports, you can use the following command:

`./gradlew koverXmlReport`

`koverXmlReport` will build, execute tests and then write out an XML report in the specified report location. The default location for Kover reports is:`build/reports/kover/xml/report.xml`.

> Note that kover will automatically run your full test suite by default. If you instead want to execute tests separately, make sure to include `-x test` in gradle's arguments.

You can then use the DeepSource CLI to upload this report:

Shell

`# Install deepsource CLI curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set the DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the reporting tab of # your repository's DeepSource settings page. export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the project's root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key kotlin --value-file build/reports/kover/xml/report.xml`

### 

Scala

[](#scala)

#### 

Jacoco

[](#jacoco-2)

Add `sbt-jacoco` to your project by adding the following line to your `project/plugins.sbt` -

`addSbtPlugin("com.github.sbt" % "sbt-jacoco" % "<version>")`

Then run `sbt jacoco` to generate the coverage report. By default, you'll find the report in `/target/scala-{version}/jacoco/report`.

Note: To tweak Jacoco and its coverage behavior, you'll have to make changes to your `build.sbt`. Refer Jacoco's [documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-jacoco/getting-started.html)  
for more information on this.

Once you have a coverage report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the following commands:

Shell

`# Install deepsource CLI curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set the DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the reporting tab of # your repository's DeepSource settings page. export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the project's root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key scala --value-file target/scala-2.13/jacoco/report/jacoco.xml`

Note: Since we support Cobertura for other languages as well, you should be able to follow the above similar steps for generating and uploading your Cobertura report.

### 

PHP

[](#php)

#### 

PHPUnit

[](#phpunit)

Currently, only the Cobertura XML format is supported by DeepSource.

Here are the steps to report PHP coverage data.

Bash

`# Install phpunit/phpunit pacakage from composer composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit  # Run coverage vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-cobertura coverage.xml  # Install 'deepsource CLI' curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://  # From the root directory, run the report coverage command ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key php --value-file ./coverage.xml`

Reporting coverage from tests running in Docker container

[](#reporting-coverage-from-tests-running-in-docker-container)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running tests inside a Docker container is a widely used practice in the  
software development community since it provides a consistent environment to run  
the application.

But, at the same time it also adds isolation and therefore, the  
test coverage reports generated inside the container are not accessible to the  
outside environment i.e. the CI systems on which the testing pipeline is  
running.

However, the following two methods can be used to report the test coverage  
data to DeepSource.

### 

Inside the Docker container

[](#inside-the-docker-container)

For reporting test coverage to DeepSource from inside the container which runs  
tests, just pass some environment variables to the container using the `--env/-e` flag.

GitHub Actions

`docker run -e DEEPSOURCE_DSN -e GITHUB_ACTIONS -e GITHUB_REF -e GITHUB_SHA ...`

Travis CI

`docker run -e DEEPSOURCE_DSN -e USER -e TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SHA ...`

Others

`# Export the latest git commit hash as an environment variable export GIT_COMMIT_SHA=$(git --no-pager rev-parse HEAD | tr -d '\n')  # Pass the exported environment variable to the container in which tests # need to be run docker run -e DEEPSOURCE_DSN -e GIT_COMMIT_SHA ...`

### 

Outside the Docker container

[](#outside-the-docker-container)

The test coverage report can also be reported by copying it from the Docker container  
in which tests are run to a shared directory which the host can also access.

Shell

``# Creating a directory to store test coverage data in the host # This directory will be mounted in the docker container as well mkdir shared_coverage  # Run the Docker container which runs tests # The `-v` flag sets up a bindmount volume that links the ~/coverage directory # from inside the container to the ~/shared_coverage directory on the host machine. docker run --name=test -v "~/shared_coverage:$HOME/coverage" ...  # Report the test coverage report stored in the shared directory to DeepSource ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./shared_coverage/coverage.xml``

In the Dockerfile of the container which runs test, make sure that the generated test  
coverage report is moved to the shared directory.

Shell

`# In the container Dockerfile mv coverage.xml ~/coverage`

Automating Test Coverage Tracking with CI

[](#automating-test-coverage-tracking-with-ci)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using a CI to run your tests, the recommended way to use the Test Coverage Analyzer is by automating the coverage reporting from your CI.  
This should be done in the scripts that are running your tests.

These are the things that you'd need to take care of:

1.  Enable the `test-coverage` Analyzer in your repository's `.deepsource.toml` file.
2.  Make sure that your CI is checking out the same commit and not making a merge commit. Failing to do this would cause the coverage report to be associated with the merge commit, and DeepSource would never pick it up for a run.
3.  Install the DeepSource CLI. This would be needed to report the coverage artifact.
4.  DeepSource DSN for the repository. This is needed to identify the repository for which the coverage report is being sent. The CLI looks for the DSN

> ðŸš§

> Do not add the `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` variable as part of any publicly visible configuration file. It contains sensitive information.

The sections below contain boilerplate config for different CI providers.  
Please refer to to learn more about the CLI's `report` command used in the examples.

### 

With Travis CI

[](#with-travis-ci)

1.  On Travis CI, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add a `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` environment variable with the DSN copied above as its value.
    
2.  Add this to `.travis.yml`:
    
    YAML
    
    `after_success:   # Phase: Tests have finished and a test coverage report is available    # Install the deepsource CLI   - curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh    # From the root directory, run the report coverage command   - ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./path/to/report`
    

### 

With Circle CI

[](#with-circle-ci)

1.  On Circle CI, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add a `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` environment variable with the DSN copied above as its value.
    
2.  Add the following step in `.circleci/config.yml`:
    
    YAML
    
    `- run:   name: Report results to DeepSource   command: |     # Tests have finished and a test coverage report is available      # Install the deepsource CLI     curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh      # From the root directory, run the report coverage command     ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./path/to/report`
    

### 

With GitHub Actions

[](#with-github-actions)

1.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click "Settings". In the left sidebar, click **Secrets**.
    
    *   Type `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` in the "Name" input box.
    *   Add the value copied above.
2.  When you checkout code, ensure that you use pull request HEAD commit instead of merge commit:
    
    > ðŸš§
    > --
    > 
    > GitHub actions make a merge commit during checkout unless it is asked not to do it. If you're using GitHub actions, please make sure you make the following change in your checkout action.
    
    YAML
    
      `- uses: actions/checkout@v3     with:       ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}`
    
3.  Add the following step in `.github/workflows/main.yml`:
    

YAML

  `- name: Report results to DeepSource     run: |     # Tests have finished and a test coverage report is available      # Install deepsource CLI       curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh      # From the root directory, run the report coverage command       ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./path/to/report      env:       DEEPSOURCE_DSN: ${{ secrets.DEEPSOURCE_DSN }}`

### 

With GitLab CI

[](#with-gitlab-ci)

1.  Navigate to the project page of the repository on GitLab. Under project  
    settings, in the sidebar, click on **"CI/CD"**. Expand the variable  
    section, and add the following:
    
    *   Type: "Variable"\`
    *   Key: `DEEPSOURCE_DSN`
    *   Value: The DSN value copied above
    *   State: Protected (Yes)
    *   Masked: Yes
    *   Scope: All Environments
2.  Add the following under the test job in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:
    
    YAML
    
    `test:   script:     # Tests have finished and a test coverage report is available      # Install deepsource CLI     - curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh      # From the root directory, run the report coverage command     - ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value file ./path/to/report`
    

### 

With Heroku CI

[](#with-heroku-ci)

1.  Navigate to the appâ€™s **Settings** tab in the Heroku Dashboard and then add the **Config Variables**:
    
    *   KEY: `DEEPSOURCE_DSN`
    *   VALUE: The DSN value copied above
2.  Run the following commands:
    
    YAML
    
    `# Tests have finished and a test coverage report is available  # Install deepsource CLI - curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh  # From the root directory, run the report coverage command for DeepSource to analyze it - ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./path/to/report`
    

### 

With Azure Pipelines

[](#with-azure-pipelines)

1.  [Set a secret variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/set-secret-variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml,bash) for the repository's DSN to be used in the pipeline.
    
    *   Name: `DEEPSOURCE_DSN`
    *   Value: The DSN value for your repository on DeepSource
2.  Add the following script in the pipeline(s) running tests for the repository:
    
    YAML
    
    `# Add this after the script to run tests, which also generates a coverage report - script: |   # Install deepsource CLI   curl -sSL https://deepsource.io/cli | sh    # From the root directory, run the report coverage command for DeepSource to analyze it   ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --value-file ./path/to/report  displayName: "Report coverage results to DeepSource" env: DEEPSOURCE_DSN: $(DEEPSOURCE_DSN)`
    

> ðŸš§
> --
> 
> In case of pull requests, Azure DevOps can make a merge commit that doesn't belong to the Repo's actual GIT tree.  
> You can let DeepSource know about the correct commit OID of PR it should associate the coverage report to by setting the following environment variable.
> 
> YAML
> 
> `env: GIT_COMMIT_SHA: $(System.PullRequest.SourceCommitId)`
