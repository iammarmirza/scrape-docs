Invite team members
===================

When logged in to a team or organization account, you can invite new users to your DeepSource team by navigating to the Members tab and clicking on 'Invite new member'. From there, you can send an invitation via email or an invite link. If you choose to send an email invitation, you will have the option to select the level of access you want to grant to the new member. The available access levels include Admin, Member, or Contributor.

Inviting someone using the invite link is simple. All you need to do is copy and share the invite link with the person you wish to invite. Once the recipient signs up using the link, they will be automatically added to your team as a 'Member'. It's worth noting that the access level of the new member can be changed by the owner at any time.
