2.  Select **"Applications"** from the sidebar which appears on the left.
3.  You'd be prompted to fill a form to create a new application. Enter the following details:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

Gitlab Self-hosted

[](#gitlab-self-hosted)

1.  Navigate to the Admin section and go to System Hooks.
2.  Create a new system hook with the following information:
    1.  URL: `https://<deepsource-installation-url>/services/webhooks/gitlab/`
    2.  Secret token: Set this to the same value as set in the configuration (in the values.yaml file or the Admin Console config panel).
    3.  Select "push events" and "merge request events" as triggers.
    4.  Set "SSL Verification" to true.

### 

Gitlab Cloud

[](#gitlab-cloud)

1.  Navigate to the project or group that you want to create webhooks on. (Gitlab does not allow an org-wide option to enable webhooks).
2.  Go to Settings > Webhooks > Add new webhook, and enter the following:
    1.  URL: `https://<deepsource-installation-url>/services/webhooks/gitlab/`
    2.  Secret token: Set this to the same value as set in the configuration (in the values.yaml file or the Admin Console config panel).
    3.  Select "push events" and "merge request events" as triggers.
    4.  Enable SSL verification.

Configuring the GitLab application in the Admin Console

[](#configuring-the-gitlab-application-in-the-admin-console)
=======================================================================================================================

After you create your GitLab application, you need to configure these in the Admin Console for the application to use it.

1.  Visit the **Admin Console**
2.  Navigate to **Application** -> **Config**.
3.  Select the checkbox for **GitLab**.
4.  Fill up the values from the previous step for:
    1.  GitLab Application ID
    2.  GitLab Application Name
    3.  GitLab Application Secret
    4.  GitLab Host Domain
    5.  GitLab Webhook Secret
5.  Click **Save config**
