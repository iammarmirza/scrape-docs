Managing people's access to team with roles
===========================================

Permission levels for teams

[](#permission-levels-for-teams)
===============================================================

Teams can have administrators, members, and contributors.

*   **Administrators** have complete administrative access to your team. They can manage billing, add or remove team members, and change roles for other members of the team.
*   **Members** have the ability to activate analysis on new repositories. This is the default role.
*   **Contributors** don't have any team level access. Adding a contributor doesn't add against a seat on the paid plan.
