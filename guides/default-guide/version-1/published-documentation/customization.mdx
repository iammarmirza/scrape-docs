Customization
=============

Change the look and feel of your published docs site by adding a custom logo, changing theme colors and personalizing the footer to align your site with your brand.

Last updated 1 month ago

You can customize the appearance of your published documentation, match the user interface to the language of your content, and more.

You can apply customizations to your entire docs site as a site-wide theme, or to individual using overrides.

**Permissions**

Admins and creators in a space published as part of a docs site can edit customization settings.
