Search & Quick find
===================

Search and navigate your documentation fast with quick find.

GitBook’s quick find palette lets you search for content across all your organizations, and jump between them fast.

**Permissions**

All can use the **quick find**, but members will only be able to search the internal content they have permission to access.‌

How to use quick find

**​**You can open the quick find palette by pressing **⌘ + K** on Mac or **Ctrl + K** on PC.

[](#display-of-results)

Search results

Results from the space you’re currently in appear at the top, followed by results from other spaces from the organization you’re currently working in — **as well as other organizations** you are a member of.

When you select a search result from an organization, you’ll switch to browsing that organization. To go back, use quick find to select a document in the organization you were in before, or use in the sidebar.

We do not currently support the ability to prioritize certain content in quick find results.

### 

[](#team-permissions)

​Team permissions

**Quick find** is compliant with your team’s permission settings, meaning that users will only be able to search the content they have permission to access.‌

**Note:** Multiple space search is _only_ available when viewing a published that lives inside of a . It is not available across individual published spaces in different collections.

[](#indexation)

Content Indexing

We index your content by grouping it into sections. Sections are denoted using , with the content that follows them forming part a section.

Each result shows the first three lines of information below the section header. If your section is too big, your keyword match may not appear in the preview — but don’t worry, quick find still found a match!
