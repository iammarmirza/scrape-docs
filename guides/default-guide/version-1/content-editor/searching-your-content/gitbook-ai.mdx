GitBook AI
==========

GitBook uses AI to help you find the knowledge you need, faster.

Last updated 1 month ago

Simply tell GitBook AI what you want, or ask it a question. It’ll use AI to scan your documentation and give you a simple, semantic answer — with clickable references if you want to dive deeper.

#### 

[](#using-gitbook-ai-in-published-documentation)

Using GitBook AI in published documentation

Let’s give it a try right here in our own public documentation! Firstly, open the search palette by clicking **Ask or search…** in the top-right corner of the page, or by press **⌘ + K** on a Mac or **Ctrl + K** on a PC.

Then simply type your question and press `Enter`. You’ll see a number of suggested questions that you might like to ask.

For this example, let's try: “What makes change requests a powerful GitBook feature?” After a few seconds, you’ll get an answer from GitBook AI.

As well as a summarized answer, below you’ll also see an expandable section that shows the sources that GitBook AI used to create its answer, plus related questions you can click as a follow-up.

**Note:** GitBook AI does not work across individual published spaces in different collections. **Multi-space search is** _**only**_ **available when viewing published** **that live inside of a** **.**

Integrating GitBook AI with your product

With our API, you can embed GitBook AI into your product or website! This opens up lots of possibilities, including in-app helpers and website chat bots that can respond to questions based on the content in your documentation.

[](#how-long-does-it-take-for-gitbook-ai-to-index-changes)

How long does it take for GitBook AI to index changes?

When someone makes a change to your content — such as a merged or a new from Slack) it can take **up to one hour** for GitBook to index the changes to and reflect them in AI search results.

#### 

[](#how-does-gitbook-ai-handle-my-data)

How does GitBook AI handle my data?

We pass your content to OpenAI to index and process data. OpenAI **does not** use this content for service improvements (including model training). You can find out more about how OpenAI handles data [here](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis#developer-focus).

#### 

[](#how-do-i-prevent-hallucinations-with-gitbook-ai-search)

How do I prevent hallucinations with GitBook AI search?

If you’re seeing GitBook produce answers that are incorrect, the best method for correcting this is write explicit content around the topic so the AI does not have to guess.
