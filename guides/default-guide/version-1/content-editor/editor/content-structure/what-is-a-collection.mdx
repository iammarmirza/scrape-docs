Collections
===========

Organize your spaces and group related ones together using collections

Last updated 1 month ago

Collections are groups of spaces focused around a specific topic, team or purpose. You can think of them as a folder for your spaces.

Collections allow you to:

*   organize your content by similar topics or ideas
    
*   manage space at scale by allowing you to override the organization-level defaults
    

### 

[](#create-a-collection)

Create a collection

Click the **+** button next to the **Documentation** header in the sidebar to create a new collection. You can also create a collection or space within another collection from the collection’s main page.

### 

[](#move-a-collection)

### 

[](#nested-collections)

Nested collections

You can nest collections inside each other, creating a collection -> sub-collection -> space hierarchy.

Open a collection and you can click **New collection** from the collection’s main page to create a sub-collection.

How to delete a collection

**Deleting a collection is final**, but spaces inside a deleted collection will move to the **Trash** and can be restored up to seven days after deletion. You can access the Trash from the bottom of the sidebar.

You can move a collection by opening the **Action menu** , selecting **Move collection to…** and choosing a destination. Alternatively, you can drag and drop collections in the sidebar to move or reorder them. You can move collections into other collections — or even to other organizations, if you have an in both.

To move one collection into another, click **Move collection to…** from the collection’s **Action menu** and then choose its new location. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the collection to its new location.

You can delete a collection by opening it’s **Action menu** and selecting **Delete**.
