Unordered lists
===============

Add an unordered list block to a page to quickly create bullet point lists — with indents if needed.

Unordered lists are great for making a series of points that do not necessarily need to be made in a particular order. They are effectively bullet point lists, with support for nesting as needed.

When typing a list in GitBook, you can exit the list and start a new empty block below by hitting `Enter` twice.

Example of unordered list

*   Item
    
    *   Nested item
        
        *   Another nested item
            
        
    *   Yet another nested item
        
    
*   Another item
    
*   Yet another item
    

To create nested items, you can use **Tab** to indent and **⇧ + Tab** to outdent.
