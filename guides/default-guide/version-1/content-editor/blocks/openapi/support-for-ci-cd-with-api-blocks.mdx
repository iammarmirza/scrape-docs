Support for CI/CD with API blocks
=================================

How to use GitBook’s OpenAPI method blocks to support a CI/CD workflow

Our OpenAPI block supports CI/CD, which means your API documentation can auto-update when a new version is released. The method of updating depends on whether you upload your API spec via URL or as a file.

[](#url-upload)

URL upload


-------------------------------

If you upload your API spec via a URL, your docs will auto-update existing API references when they change in the spec. However, when the OpenAPI file is changed, the cache will not be updated immediately. It may take a few hours for the published docs to reflect the latest version, but it can take up to a day.

For example, [this](https://github.com/GitbookIO/integrations/blob/main/docs/gitbook-api/reference/collections.md) is the method we use in our developer docs.

[](#api-file-upload)

API file upload


-----------------------------------------

If you upload your API spec as a file, you will have to re-upload the new version of the file in order to update your documentation. However, GitBook will detect existing blocks on the same page and auto-update them when you upload the file.

An alternative solution is to use Git Sync with an OpenAPI spec file in the synced repository. Store the OpenAPI spec in a repository as a JSON/YAML file and reference it in Markdown:

Copy

    {% swagger src="./openapi.json" path="/collections/{collectionId}" method="get" expanded="true" %} 
    [openapi.json](./openapi.json) 
    {% endswagger %}

Every time this file changes and a commit is pushed to GitHub, your docs will also update. This ensures that your documentation is always up to date with your latest API changes.
