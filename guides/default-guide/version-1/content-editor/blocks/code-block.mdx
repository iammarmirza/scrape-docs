Code blocks
===========

Add a code block to a page to include sample code, configurations, code snippets and more.

You can add code to your GitBook pages using code blocks.

When you add a code block, you can choose to , , , and . It’s also easy to , so you can use it elsewhere

A code block may be useful for:

*   Sharing configurations
    
*   Adding code snippets
    
*   Sharing code files
    
*   Showing usage examples of command line utilities
    
*   Showing how to call API endpoints
    
*   And much more!
    

### 

[](#example-of-a-code-block)

Example of a code block

index.js

Copy

    ‌import * as React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import App from './App';
    
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, window.document.getElementById('root'));

You can also combine code blocks with a to offer the same code example in multiple different languages:

JavaScriptRubyElixir

Copy

    let greeting = function (name) {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    };
    greeting("Anna");

Copy

    greeting = lambda {|name| puts "Hello, #{name}!"}
    greeting.("Anna")

Copy

    greeting = fn name -> IO.puts("Hello, #{name}!") end
    greeting.("Anna")

### 

[](#options)

Code block options

#### 

[](#set-syntax)

Set syntax…

You can set the syntax in your code block to any of the supported languages. This will enable syntax highlighting in that language, too.

We use [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) for syntax highlighting. You can use [Test Drive Prism](https://prismjs.com/test.html#language=markup) to check which languages Prism supports. If you notice a mismatch between GitBook and Prism, there’s a chance we’re a version or two behind. We’ll catch up soon!

    // Some code

#### 

[](#with-line-numbers)

With line numbers

This will toggle line numbers for your code on and off.

Showing line numbers is useful when the code represents the contents of a file as a whole, or when you have long code blocks with lots of lines. Hiding line numbers is useful for snippets, usage instructions for command line or terminal expressions and similar scenarios.

#### 

[](#with-caption)

With caption

This will toggle a caption that sits at the top of the block, above your lines of code.

The caption is often the name of a file as shown in , but you can also use it as a title, description, or anything else you’d like.

#### 

[](#wrap-code)

Wrap code

This will toggle code wrapping on and off, so long lines of code will wrap to all be visible on the page at once.

Wrapping lines is useful when your code is long and you want to avoid having the viewer scroll back and forth to read it. If you toggle **Wrap code** on, you may also want to show line numbers — this will make it easier to read the code and understand where new lines start.

### 

[](#actions)

Actions

As well as the options above, you can also change the language the code block displays, and copy your code instantly.

#### 

[](#copying-the-code)

Copy the code

Hover over a code block and a number of icons will appear. Click the middle icon to copy the contents of the code block to your clipboard in one click.

### 

[](#representation-in-markdown)

Representation in Markdown

Copy

    {% code title="index.js" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
    
    ```javascript
    ‌import * as React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import App from './App';
    
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, window.document.getElementById('root'));
    ```
    
    {% endcode %}

You can make code blocks by clicking on the **Options menu** next to the block and choosing **Full width**.

When you click on the **Options menu** next to the code block, or the **Actions menu** in the block itself, you’ll see a number of options you can set.
