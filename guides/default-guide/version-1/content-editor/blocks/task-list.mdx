Task lists
==========

Add a task list to a page, then check off the tasks as you complete them — perfect for to-dos.

Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes that you can check or uncheck. This is useful for tracking project items, creating playbooks and more.

**Note:** Readers of your published space will not be able to check or uncheck these boxes. You can decide which boxes are checked and unchecked when you create the content.

Example of a task list

*   Here’s a task that hasn’t been done
    
    *   Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using `Tab`.
        
    *   Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done.
        
    
*   Finally, an item, unindented using `shift` + `tab`.
