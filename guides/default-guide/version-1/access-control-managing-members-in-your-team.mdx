Automatic sync with GitHub

[](#automatic-sync-with-github)
-------------------------------------------------------------

By setting up Automatic Sync (currently only available for GitHub), we can sync access settings for you without any manual intervention. Whenever the permissions, or roles are changed on GitHub, whether repository-wide or organization-wide, we are notified via a webhook, and we update the settings automatically. This means that if a user exists on both GitHub and DeepSource, their access settings will automatically be synced from GitHub in the following events:

*   When you remove an organization member on GitHub, they get removed from the DeepSource team as well.
*   When you add a new team member on DeepSource that is a member of your organization on GitHub as well, they get added as a repository collaborator on all repositories\[1\] with the same permission as on GitHub.
*   When you add, edit permission, or remove a repository collaborator from a repository on GitHub, the same is replicated on DeepSource.
