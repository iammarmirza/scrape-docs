Vanta is an industry leader in compliance automation and is trusted by thousands of companies. They simplify the complex, time-consuming process of preparing for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and several other compliances, and automate the implementation and monitoring of controls, which not only reduces the risk of data breaches but also gives you the security credibility you need.

DeepSource periodically reports security issues found in the default branch of all your repositories to Vanta, making it easier for you to keep track of your organization's source code compliance.
