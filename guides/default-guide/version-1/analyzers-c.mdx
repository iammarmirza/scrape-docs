Configuration - `.deepsource.toml`

[](#configuration---deepsourcetoml)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section covers configuration specific to the `C#` analyzer. Please make sure you read the general [configuration guide](https://deepsource-docs.readme.io/docs/configuration) first.

### 

`name`

[](#name)

*   **Type**: [String](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#string)
*   **Presence**: mandatory
*   **Description**: Shortcode of the analyzer.
*   **Example**:

TOML

`name = "csharp"`

### 

`enabled`

[](#enabled)

*   **Type**: [Boolean](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#boolean)
*   **Presence**: optional
*   **Description**: Toggle whether this analyzer should be run.
*   **Example**:

TOML

`enabled = true`

#### 

`cyclomatic_complexity_threshold`

[](#cyclomatic_complexity_threshold)

*   **Type**: [String](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#string)
    
*   **Presence**: optional
    
*   **Description**: Specify the acceptable risk category for your project as the threshold. All functions with complexity beyond this threshold will raise an issue. For example, setting the threshold to `low` will flag all functions that have a cyclomatic complexity of more than `5`, while setting the threshold to `critical` will not flag any function.
    
*   **Available Values**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very-high` and `critical`
    

Risk category

Cyclomatic complexity range

Recommended action

low

1-5

No action is needed.

medium

6-15

Review and monitor.

high

16-25

Review and refactor. Recommended to add detailed comments if the function absolutely needs to be kept as it is.

very-high

26-50

Refactor to reduce the complexity.

critical

\>50

Must refactor this. This can make the code untestable and very difficult to understand.

*   **Default Value**: `high`
*   **Example**:

TOML

`[analyzers.meta] cyclomatic_complexity_threshold = "very-high"`

Sample config

[](#sample-config)
-----------------------------------

TOML

`version = 1  test_patterns = [   "tests/**",   "*Test.cs" ]  exclude_patterns = [   "**/examples/**" ]  [[analyzers]] name = "csharp" enabled = true`
