Sharing a collection

To share a collection, click the **Share** button in the top-right corner of a collection. This will open the share modal.

Inside the share modal, you’ll see different sharing options along the top.

The options available to you will depend on your permissions in the space, as well as .

By default, every member of your organization can see all the content in your organization. But their permissions are inherited from the assigned to them within the area.

You can see everyone who access to your collection, and their level of access, in the share modal. You can also make changes to those access settings in this menu.

Invite a person or team from your organization

Some people in your team may not have access to a specific collection in your GitBook organization due to their role or specific permissions settings. To invite someone who’s already a member of your organization, simply type their name, choose their role for this collection, and hit Invite.

Invite someone from outside your organization

Inviting someone either as a full member or a guest will make them a member of the organization that owns the collection, which **will increase your overall subscription charge.**

The cost for this will depend on .

[](#invite-guests-via-link)

Invite guests via link

If you don’t want to use email to invite someone to your content, or want to invite a number of people as guests quickly, you can create a secret link. You can also set the role of guests that join using the link, so you have control over who can do what to your content.

When you share this link, anyone who clicks on it will be able to sign up, join your organization as a , and get access to just this single collection and its content.

You can revoke the link at any time by opening the **Actions menu** next to the link and choosing **Revoke**.
