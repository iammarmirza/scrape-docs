Comments
========

Ask questions or receive feedback on the content you create in GitBook.

Comments allow you to have as much (or as little) conversation as you like around specific pieces of content — without switching out of context from GitBook.

### 

[](#comment-within-your-content)

Add a comment to your content

You can comment on any block within your content. Hover over a block and click the content icon that appears on the right of the block to open the **Comments** side panel with an empty comment. You can open this panel again by clicking on the **Comments** button ![](https://docs.gitbook.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1050631731-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%252Fuploads%252FMJNYA9JrjVxXimhQUTMJ%252Fcomments-light.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D87d5dc84-687d-4315-a9c8-8724eec25ba6&width=32&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=9ce0982f&sv=1)![](https://docs.gitbook.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1050631731-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%252Fuploads%252F9h80IWux1OQO7IAAEoMv%252Fcomments-dark.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7dbf3dcb-109d-4652-9eb7-c54c7cca4d04&width=32&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=27404f2f&sv=1) in the .
