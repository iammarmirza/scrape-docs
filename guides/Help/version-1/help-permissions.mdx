Permissions
===========

When you start using DeepSource, you will need to explicitly grant DeepSource permission through your source code hosting provider to checkout your public and private repositories. To perform analysis, we checkout your code from supported source code hosting providers.

DeepSource does not store your source code. As soon as the analysis transaction is complete, the source code is purged from our infrastructure and is not backed up. The following are the permissions we would require:

> The "Act on your behalf" permission alert gets triggered because we require an OAuth token from your source control provider. We only use your OAuth token to validate your identity.

Bitbucket

[](#bitbucket)
---------------------------

### 

OAuth

[](#oauth-3)

*   Read-only access to the user's account information. Note that this does not include any ability to mutate any of the data. The account information includes:
    *   See all email addresses

    *   Location
    *   Website
    *   Full name

### 

Bitbucket add-on

[](#bitbucket-add-on)

*   Read-only access to the user's account information. Note that this does not include any ability to mutate any of the data. Scope: `account`.
    
*   Read access to pull requests and collaborate on them. This scope implies repository, giving read access to the pull request's destination repository. Scope: `pullrequest`.
    
*   Ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repository members can. This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is attached to. Scope: `issue`.

### 

Autofix add-on

[](#autofix-add-on)

*   Read-only access to the user's account information. Note that this does not include any ability to mutate any of the data. Scope: `account`.
    
*   Ability to create, merge, and decline pull requests. This scope implies `repository:write` permissions, giving write access to the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to facilitate merging. Scope: `pullrequest:write`.
    
*   Gives the app admin access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to. No distinction is made between public or private repositories. This scope does not imply `repository` or `repository:write` permissions. It gives access to only the admin features of a repository, not direct access to its contents. Of course, this can be (mis)used to grant read access to another user account who can then clone the repository, but apps that need to read or write source code would also request explicit read or write permissions for the concerned repository. Scope: `repository:admin`.

> Note that the `repository:admin` scope is required to check the possibility of a commit. For this purpose, we use the [branch restrictions API](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/branch-restrictions) which requires this scope to function.
