# Support

Whether you're having trouble with your account or billing, need to report a security issue, want to report false positives, have discovered a bug, want to request a feature, or just want to share some feedback with us, we're here to help. Our goal is to ensure that your experience with DeepSource is as smooth and hassle-free as possible, and we're always available to answer your questions and address your concerns. **Response to support tickets are sent via e-mail.**

We have three different support tiers depending on the user's plan.

Community Support: Free and Starer plans

## [](#community-support-free-and-starer-plans)

The [DeepSource Discuss forum](https://discuss.deepsource.com/) is where you can ask questions, give feedback, and report bugs.

If you have a feature request, you may create a post on our [Product Roadmap](https://roadmap.deepsource.com/tabs/2-planned).

Dedicated Support: Business plan

## [](#dedicated-support-business-plan)

In addition to the [DeepSource Discuss forum](https://discuss.deepsource.com/), users on the Business plan may raise tickets through the [support portal](https://discuss.deepsource.com/).

Priority Support: Enterprise plan

## [](#priority-support-enterprise-plan)

Enterprise customers may report issues either through the [support portal](https://app.deepsource.com/support) or by sending an email to \[email¬†protected\]. For Enterprise Server (on-premise) installations, the support portal can be accessed by visiting <INSTALLATION_URL />support.

Response and Resolution (Priority Support)

[](#response-and-resolution-priority-support)

DeepSource's customer support will categorize all reported issues and forward them to the corresponding team to resolve. The severity of issues is categorized into four levels, which are illustrated in the table below:

Severity Level

Priority Definition

Response Time

P0

**Urgent**: The most severe type of error. It can be described as a showstopper, a critical failure in operational activity where no workaround is available.

12 hours

P1

**High**: This is the second most severe type of error. These problems are considered high impact issues. Problems in this assessment category include an application that is inoperative or seriously degraded where a short-term workaround is available.

24 hours

P2

**Medium**: The error limits the functionality or usefulness of the application, but the condition is not critical to the continued operation of the Hosted Product. A workaround is readily available and can be applied or used with little or no operational impact.

48 hours

P3

**Low**: This is the least severe type of error. It can be described as a minimal problem arising from a misleading or unsatisfactory component or feature. The problem can be circumvented with no operational impact and there are no data integrity issues. Deferred maintenance of ‚Äúlow‚Äù error is acceptable.
