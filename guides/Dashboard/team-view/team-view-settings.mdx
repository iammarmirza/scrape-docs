Billing

[](#billing)
-----------------------

### 

Upgrade plan

[](#upgrade-plan)

To upgrade your DeepSource plan, you can choose between two options: the Starter plan or the Business plan. These plans are designed to meet the needs of small to medium-sized teams. For larger teams with specific needs, there is an Enterprise plan that supports on-premise deployments. Choose the plan that best suits your team's requirements.

### 

View usage details of the current plan

[](#view-usage-details-of-the-current-plan)

You can view the usage details of your current DeepSource plan by navigating to the usage details section. Here, you will find information about the number of seats used, commits analyzed, Transformer runs, and Autofixed runs used. This information can help you track your team's usage and ensure that you are making the most of your plan.

### 

Edit billing information

[](#edit-billing-information)

To edit your billing information, you can navigate to the billing section and make changes to your billing email, billing address, and credit card information.

> ðŸ“˜

> 
> For the Enterprise plan, billing is managed manually, and if you need to make any changes to your plan, you must contact DeepSource support. To do so, click on 'Contact DeepSource,' and a member of our team will respond to your inquiry as soon as possible.

Access control

[](#access-control)
-------------------------------------

### 

Provider permissions

[](#provider-permissions)

To simplify access management in DeepSource, you can enable Provider Permissions by toggling it on. This feature allows you to automatically sync access settings from your GitHub account, saving you the time and effort required to manage access settings manually.

### 

Access permissions

[](#access-permissions)

#### 

Member base permissions

[](#member-base-permissions)

Team Administrators can set base permissions for team-owned repositories. These base permissions apply to all team members when accessing any of the team's repositories.

> ðŸ“˜
> --
> 
> Base permissions do not apply to contributors or administrators. If a team member is granted a higher level of permission for a repository by an administrator, the higher level of permission will override the base permission.

To set base permissions for team-owned repositories, go to the Member Permissions section and select the new base permission. Team Administrators can choose from several options such as read-only, write access, or admin access. This allows you to control who has access to sensitive repositories and ensure that team members have the appropriate level of access.

### 

Issue, metric thresholds, and suppress metric permissions

[](#issue-metric-thresholds-and-suppress-metric-permissions)

Team Administrators to grant or revoke permissions to members and contributors for ignoring issues, modifying metric thresholds, and suppressing failed metrics. This helps ensure that the right people have the appropriate level of access to manage issues and metrics effectively.

To grant or revoke these permissions, go to the Issue, Metric Thresholds, and Suppress Metric Permissions section. From there, you can select which level of access to grant: member, contributor, or both. You can also choose to revoke access if necessary.

Auto Onboard

[](#auto-onboard)
---------------------------------

With Auto Onboard, you can create configuration templates to easily activate analysis on multiple repositories in one go. This is especially useful for large teams with multiple repositories as it eliminates the need to manually configure the .deepsource.toml file and activate DeepSource for each repository. To create a new template, simply click on "Add new template", give it a name and description, and select which Analyzers you want to enable for analysis.

Once the template is created, click 'Use template' button and select the repositories to onboard this template with. DeepSource will automatically create pull requests to all the selected repositories with a `.deepsource.toml file`. Once merged, analysis will be automatically activated on your repositories.

> ðŸ“˜

> 
> We recommend you notify the repository maintainers to expect the pull request from DeepSource and send link to the .

Webhooks

[](#webhooks)
-------------------------

DeepSource's webhooks allow you to automatically trigger reactions in response to specific events that occur in your account. With webhooks, you can easily integrate DeepSource with your other tools and services, such as issue trackers, messaging platforms, and more.

To get started, configure an endpoint URL that can receive a POST request from DeepSource whenever an event is triggered. You can also choose to enable API signing, which adds an extra layer of security by including an HMAC signature of the payload.

To configure your webhooks, click on 'Add new endpoint' and provide the required details, including the endpoint URL, webhook secret, and one or more events to trigger the webhook. Note that webhooks are only available for organization accounts.

Issue priority

[](#issue-priority)
-------------------------------------

You can set issue priorities in the DeepSource Dashboard to help prioritize and focus on the most important issues. Assigning a priority of High, Medium, or Low to each issue can help you quickly identify and address critical issues while ignoring less urgent ones. This feature can help you streamline your workflow and make your issue management more efficient.

Integrations

[](#integrations)
---------------------------------

###

*   New issues introduced in the default branch
*   Issues resolved in the default branch
*   Issues fixed with Autofixâ„¢
*   Repository activation status changes

### 

Jira Cloud integration

[](#jira-cloud-integration)

The Jira Cloud integration allows you to create new Jira issues for any issues detected by DeepSource on your codebase. By enabling this integration, you can easily keep track of and manage DeepSource issues in Jira, allowing for seamless collaboration between your development and project management teams.

Security

[](#security)
-------------------------

### 

SAML Single Sign-On

[](#saml-single-sign-on)

If you're using DeepSource Enterprise Cloud, you can set up SAML 2.0-based Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication.

To set up SAML SSO, you'll first need to verify the ownership of your organization's email domain, which should match the domain name of your users' email addresses. Simply enter the domain name in DeepSource and click "Request verification." We'll reach out to you via email for manual verification, and once that's done, you can configure an identity provider to connect to your DeepSource team.
