Members
=======

The Members tab is where you can efficiently manage your team — you can invite new team members, modify their access level, or remove team members as necessary.

Inviting members

[](#inviting-members)
-----------------------------------------

To invite new users to your DeepSource team, click on the 'Invite new member' button. From there, you can either send an invitation via email or an invite link. If you choose to send an email invitation, you will have the option to select the level of access you want to grant to the new member. The available access levels include Admin, Member, or Contributor.

Inviting someone using the invite link is simple. All you need to do is copy and share the invite link with the person you wish to invite. Once the recipient signs up using the link, they will be automatically added to your team as a 'Member'. It's worth noting that the access level of the new member can be changed by the owner at any time.

Transferring ownership of the Team

[](#transferring-ownership-of-the-team)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To transfer ownership of a team in DeepSource, navigate to the Members tab and click on the drop-down menu located next to the current team owner's name. From there, select the 'Transfer ownership' option. You will then be prompted to select the new owner from the list of team members.
