Integrating DeepSource with your Github account is done using a Github application. This document outlines the configuration, permission requirements and app configuration to get started with your Github account and DeepSource Enterprise.

Quick Setup

[](#quick-setup)
===============================

To create the app, you can run this quick setup script with a few additional steps. This script will open up a website with the Github app creation page and fill in the required fields automatically.

Python

`python3 <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeepSourceCorp/enterprise-assets/master/integrations/create_github_app.py)`

> ðŸ“˜
> --
> 
> If you get a 404 page when the quick setup script is run, ensure that you're logged in and that you have the permission to create apps â€” Admin access â€” for the respective organization.

1.  When you run the command in the CLI, a few user details will have to be filled in:
    1.  **The URL of your self-hosted Github instance**: For Github Cloud, you can skip this step and leave it blank. This will automatically use the default [https://github.com](https://github.com) domain.
    2.  **An organization slug**: If your organization is at [https://github.com/my-organization](https://github.com/my-organization), enter my-organization here.
    3.  **The URL of your DeepSource installation**: This should be the URL you have configured as the Application Hostname on the Admin Console.
        
        > ðŸ“˜
        > --
        > 
        > *   For a self-hosted Github Enterprise Server installation, this hostname/IP must be reachable by your Github Enterprise Server installation.
        > *   If you are using Github cloud, the URL must be reachable from the IP public internet.
        
2.  The script will open a new browser page. Complete the following steps:
    1.  Scroll to the **"Webhook"** section and check **"Active"**.
    2.  Supply a random string as the **Webhook Secret**. Make sure to remember it, as you will need it later.
    3.  Scroll to the User `Permissions` section and select `Read-only` for `Email addresses` and `Git SSH Key`.
3.  Click on **Create GitHub App**.
4.  This will take you to the About page for your Github application. Scroll down the page to the Private keys section and press **Generate a private key**. Keep this key safely since you will need to upload this in the Admin Console in the next section.
5.  Note down the following values:
    1.  **Your app slug**: This can be found in the URL. Copy the value for the `APP_SLUG` part of the URL on the Github app page. `https://github.com/organizations/acme_corp/settings/apps/<APP_SLUG>`
    2.  **Application ID**
    3.  **Client ID**
    4.  **Client Secret**: You can generate this by clicking on the Generate a new client secret button.
6.  You will use these values to configure the Github App in the Admin Console. Follow the next steps to continue.
7.  Click on `Save config` and deploy. (Ensure that you have completed the steps in the Adming Console page before you deploy.)
8.  Visit the login page on `https://<DEEPSOURCE_HOSTNAME>/login`to start using Github with DeepSource Enterprise.
