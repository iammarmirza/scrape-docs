========================

Upgrade: v3.15.0

[](#upgrade-v3150)
======================================

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes for DeepSource Enterprise Server 3.15.0 compared to 3.14.11. Please read it carefully.

Changes

[](#changes)
-----------------------

### 

Job Cleanup

[](#job-cleanup)

Analysis jobs are created in the `atlas-jobs` namespaces. Jobs once Completed or Failed need to be cleaned up so that the respective Kubernetes pods don't take up valuable resources on the nodes. To automate this cleanup we've updated the existing version of `kube-janitor` a service that cleans up Kubernetes job resources in the `atlas-jobs` namespace. Since there would already be many analysis jobs piled up in the cluster, please run the following command to clean up the respective jobs before upgrading:

`$ kubectl delete jobs -n atlas-jobs --field-selector status.successful=1`

> NOTE: This will delete all Kubernetes jobs in the `atlas-jobs` namespaces that have successfully completed. After the upgrade `kube-janitor` will automatically take care of this.

### 

Taints and Tolerations

[](#taints-and-tolerations)

DeepSource Enterprise Server 3.15.0 adds support for integrations with Slack and Jira for sending push notifications. A new Kubernetes deployment `hermes` has been added to support these integrations. The updated version of `kube-janitor` is deployed as a Kubernetes CronJob. For users that make use of taints and tolerations running DeepSource Enterprise Server in their existing Kubernetes cluster and not in the embedded cluster, taints and tolerations will have to be added via kustomize for both these services. Please refer to .
