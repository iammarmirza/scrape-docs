User Management
===============

The user management section helps you manage your enterprise users, groups, and invitation links from one place.

Users

[](#users)
-------------------

Manage all users within your enterprise from the `Users` section in user management. Check which groups and teams they are a part of, add them to groups of choice, and remove them if needed!

### 

Create a user

[](#create-a-user)

Adding a user to your DeepSource enterprise installation can be done via two ways:

*   If your organization uses SSO, please refer to on setting up an Identity Provider for adding a user.
*   If your organization uses a cloud service like GitHub, GitLab, etc as their login method, simply log in with the respective service in order to create an account.

### 

Remove a user

[](#remove-a-user)

1.  Navigate to the detailed view of a user via clicking on the user's card.
2.  Click on the `Remove user` button in the top description box area for the user.
3.  Verify if the user you have selected for deletion is the correct one. If yes, click on `Yes, delete this user`.

Groups

[](#groups)
---------------------

*   Groups are useful when you want to assign similar access levels to multiple users. Multiple groups can be created for different user cohorts and a user can be part of more than one group.
*   An admin can assign teams to a group. Teams can be added to a group with a specific role, like `admin`, `member`, or `contributor` â€” this will help decide the level of access the users of this group have to the particular team.
*   All the users that are part of the respective group, will directly get access to the selected teams as per the configuration.
