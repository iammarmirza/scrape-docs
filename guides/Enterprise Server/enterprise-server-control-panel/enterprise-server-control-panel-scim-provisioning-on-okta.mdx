FAQs & Troubleshooting

[](#faqs--troubleshooting)
----------------------------------------------------

*   **Why canâ€™t I manage Okta synced groups and users from DeepSource?**
    
    DeepSource Enterprise admins can create groups on DeepSource Enterprise installation and invite users to them. But when SCIM provisioning is enabled, the groups and users which are synced with Okta can no longer be edited on DeepSource Enterprise installation. The admin must update them from Okta.
    
*   **What if I assign new users to DeepSource Enterprise installation from Okta and there are no free seats available?**
    
    Okta will fail to push a new user and an error will be displayed on Okta:
    
    ![](https://files.readme.io/574183d-small-license-error.png)
    

To retry the task once your license has been upgraded, please follow [these steps](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/How-to-retry-failed-tasks-for-a-specific-application?language=en_US).

*   **How do I re-enable SCIM after I disabled it?**
    
    If SCIM is disabled, you can manage the group from DeepSource Enterprise installation; i.e you can add and remove users to the group from the DeepSource Enterprise control panel.
    
    In order to re-enable SCIM, ensure the is done and then perform a **[Push now](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-enable-group-push.htm#:~:text=Push%20Now%3A%20Select,are%20not%20overwritten.).** This will overwrite your DeepSource Enterprise installation groups with the data in Okta.
    
*   **What happens if I want to push a Group with the same name as a preexisting group on DeepSource?**
    
    On pushing a group, its membership will be pushed immediately. The group membership which was configured on the DeepSource Enterprise installation will be overwritten.
