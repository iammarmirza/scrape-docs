Reference: Scalars
==================

Boolean

[](#boolean)
-----------------------

The `Boolean` scalar type represents `true` or `false`.

Date

[](#date)
-----------------

The `Date` scalar represents a Date value as specified by [iso8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

DateTime

[](#datetime)
-------------------------

The `DateTime` scalar type represents a DateTime  
value as specified by  
[iso8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

JSON

[](#json)
-----------------

A [`JSON`](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) object.

ID

[](#id)
-------------

The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.

Int

[](#int)
---------------

The `Int` scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31 - 1) and 2^31 - 1 since represented in JSON as double-precision floating point numbers specifiedby [IEEE 754](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point).

Float

[](#float)
-------------------

The `Float` scalar type represents signed double‚Äêprecision fractional values as specified by [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).

JSONString

[](#jsonstring)
-----------------------------

Allows use of a JSON String for input / output from the GraphQL schema.

Use of this type is _not recommended_ as you lose the benefits of having a defined, static  
schema (one of the key benefits of GraphQL).

String

[](#string)
---------------------

The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.

UUID

[](#uuid)
-----------------

Leverages the internal Python implementation of UUID (uuid.UUID) to provide native UUID objects  
in fields, resolvers and input.
