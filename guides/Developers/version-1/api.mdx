Use the DeepSource GraphQL API to retrieve your data programmatically and easily automate your workflows.

### 

Endpoint

[](#endpoint)

For DeepSource Cloud:

`https://api.deepsource.io/graphql/`

For on-premise deployments:

`https://[hostname]/api/graphql/`

where `hostname` refers to the hostname of the DeepSource dashboard.

### 

Authentication

[](#authentication)

Authenticate via a . You need to pass it as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header:

Bash

`curl 'https://api.deepsource.io/graphql/' \ -X POST \ -H 'Authorization: Bearer <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \ -H 'accept: application/json' \ -H 'content-type: application/json' \ --data '{ "query": "query { viewer { email } }" }'`

Because GraphQL depends entirely on multiline JSON, we recommend that you use a GraphQL client like [Altair](https://altair.sirmuel.design/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). Note that the client wouldn't be able to perform requests or fetch the schema/documentation (which facilitates auto-complete) unless you add the `Authorization` header as above.

### 

Rate Limits

[](#rate-limits)

Rate limits define the maximum number of requests a single user account can make within a given period of time. If the rate limit is exceeded, the API responds with an HTTP [429 Too Many Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-http-new-status-02#section-4) response code.

Rate limits are applied at the user level and calculated across both read and write operations.

Currently, we enforce a flat rate limit of `5,000` requests per hour.
